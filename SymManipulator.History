2011

10 July - First version of SymManipulator.nb. Chosen version number 0.7.0.

-------------------

20 July - Now supposts canonicalization of nested SymH objects, if there are no internal products between SymH objects and tensors.
- If a symmetry is imposed on indices that does not exist, the corresponding points of the imposed symmetry group are stabilized.

21 July - A code for computation of the mixed symmetry in the general case is implemented. This is not very efficient, but it should give the correct result.

26 September - Bugfixes in ImposeSym.

28 September - Fixed a bug in MoveTensorsOutsideSym.

9 October - Implemented a bute force code for canonicalization of general groups. This is to be treated as experimental.
  
* Released with version number 0.8.0.

2 November - Added the functions IrrDecompose and CompleteIrrDecompose for computation of irreducible decompositions of spinor expressions.

31 December - Added an option SmartExpand for ExpandSym. This uses the combination of the imposed symmetry with the internal symmetry to reduce the number of terms in the expansion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2012

22 April - Added options for ImposeSym and CompleteIrrDecompose. 

28 April - Using xTension to ClearRememberedSymHSymmetry

29 April - Added commands SmartSymmetrize and SmartAntisymmetrize.

3 May - Moved the TexPrint functionality to TexAct.

* Released with version number 0.8.3.

18 June - ImposeSym now works on LieD, but only if it is the only factor.

1 August - Fixed a sign error when IrrDecompose works on expressions with free UpIndices. Also changed the option system for IrrDecompose.

8 November - Added the functions RuleInSym, ExpandInternalSym and ToCanonicalSym.

13 November - Changed the canonical form of the general groups to move move symmetrizations to the left to match the symmetric and antisymmetric cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013

25 January - Handles the new conventions of xPerm etc. New code for computation of mixed symmetry for the symmetric case. The old code just gave a subgroup of the correct answer. The new code is slower, but gives the correct group. Use $MixedSymSpecialCode to change which code to use.

* Released with version number 0.8.5.

11 February - Fixed a bug in MoveSymIndicesDown

13 March - Fixed a bug in TransversalComputation. Now it should be able to handle unordered bases. TransversalInSymmetricGroup now keeps the base.

12 April - Added SymmetryOfExpression.

13 April - Fixed a bug in SymmetryOfProductOfGroupsSymmetricCase. Thanks Teake for reporting this.

19 July - Fixed bugs with new xAct version.

6 August - New code for CompleteIrrDecImposeNewMethod -> True. SymmetryOfProductOfGroupsSymmetricCase2 improves performance of SymmetryOfProductOfGroupsSymmetricCase. Fixed bug in ExpandInternalSym.

7 August - Added MakeCompareRule.

11 August - Minor change in CanonicalizeGeneralGroupInSym to make it a little bit faster. A major improvement of the algorithm is needed to make it practical for larger cases.

1 September - Intruduced RemoveSuperfluousPartialSym to simplify the SymH objects for the cases where the imposed symmetry factors and all factors are not needed.

2 September - Fixed a bug with CompleteIrrDecImposeNewMethod -> True.

9 October - Added fundamental differential operators acting on symetric spinors. 
-ImposeSym now expands the expression before it imposes the symmetry. 
-Improved the sifting code that checks if a permutation is in a product. Now it computes the Schreier vectors only once. 

30 October - Added FindTensorCoefficients.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014

8 January - Changed names for functions that handles the fundamental operators acting on symmetric spinors.

24 January - More changes to the names that handle fundmental spinor operators. Added option ShowValenceInfo for DefFundSpinOperators.

* Released with version number 0.9.0.

13 March to 15 July - Added Mathlink code for an external BaseChange algorithm in xPerm.

23 July - Fixed incompatibility with SubsetQ in Mathematica 10. 

13 September - Added options for Mathlink to xperm.c. Mathlink is disabled for the new functions if they are not found in the executable. 

24 September - Updated the Mathlink code to include StabilizerSGS.

27 September - Fixed problem with the fundamental spinors operators for cases with several extra non-spinor indices.

* Released with version number 0.9.2

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2015

22 June - Fixed compatibility issue with SpinFrames by unprotecting CovarD.

* Released with version number 0.9.3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2016

12 August - Added PlaceIndicesInTensor
13 August - Added IndepIrrDecompose to remove dependencies between irreducible pieces of IrrDecompose. Also added FindSpinorsInIrrDec to find the irreducible pieces of a decomposed expression and DefIrreducibleSpinors to define and name these parts as spinors.

27 September - allow PlaceIndicesInTensor to move indices up and down.

29 November - Bug in SymmetryOfProductOfGroupsSymmetricCase2 for cases when H0 has signed permutations.  SymmetryOfProductOfGroupsSymmetricCase2b fixes this problem for the case antisym=False.

* Released with version number 0.9.4.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021

23 August - Added MakexTensions to end of DefFundSpinOperators.
24 August - Added section 7.4 with valence number functions and symmetry tests.
14 September - Fixed a bug with PrintAs for CurlDagger

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2022

21 September - Bugfix. TexFundOp did not have a default behaviour unless DefFundSpinOperators was evaluated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2024

30 April  - Improved SymmetricSpinorOfArbitraryValenceQ and related functions.
